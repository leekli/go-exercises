// Defer
// - Defer is used to ensure that a function call is performed later in a programâ€™s execution, usually for purposes of cleanup. defer is often used where e.g. ensure and finally would be used in other languages.

We can defer closing the file, and should do Immediately after getting a file object with createFile, we defer the closing of that file with closeFile. This will be executed at the end of the enclosing function (main), after writeFile has finished.
